On **April 21, 2025**, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation.

> **Title:** _Compensatory Cues of /s/ Reduction in Voiced Stop Consonants in Western Andalusian Spanish_

My dissertation explores the role of **phonetic gradience** and **perceptual thresholds** in the emergence of **compensatory voiced fricatives** (CVFs) following coda /s/ loss. It combines production, perception, and computational approaches to model how gradient features contribute to **category formation** in **Western Andalusian Spanish**.
