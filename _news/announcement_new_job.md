I’m thrilled to share that I have officially joined the Department of World Languages & Literatures at the University of Nevada, Reno as an **Assistant Professor of Hispanic & Computational Linguistics**, starting in **Fall 2025**. I’m grateful for the support and mentorship that brought me here, and I’m looking forward to collaborating with colleagues and students in this next chapter.
