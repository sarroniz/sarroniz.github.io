SEÑAL is an ongoing collaborative project intended to evaluate different components of essays written by students of Spanish as a second language. Among other functions, currently SEÑAL can provide a lexical-syntactic analysis of the complexity of an L2 essay, information about the frequency of various grammatical forms (such as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and various verb tenses), a spelling and grammatical agreement checker, and a text classiﬁer using machine learning techniques.
