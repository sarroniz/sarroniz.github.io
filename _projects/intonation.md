This project addresses the categorization of sentence meaning using pitch alignment, tonal rise, and ﬁnal falls as perceptual cues. This study takes a Laboratory Phonology approach in which a perceptual experiment was developed to observe how speakers of different dialects of Spanish make use of different intonational cues to convey sentence meaning. Speciﬁcally, this project compares Andalusian (southern Spain) and Puerto Rican speakers.
