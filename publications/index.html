We also determine if utilizing means is more effective in representing the speech signal, given the large number of coefficients produced during the feature extraction process. Finally, we evaluate whether these feature representation techniques are sensitive to speaker information.

We seek to investigate how listeners from both dialects interpret the sentence meaning of declaratives, broad focus interrogatives and counter-expectational interrogatives using pitch as the only phonological cue. To do that, two speakers from Puerto Rico and one speaker from Seville, Spain, produced the stimuli for the different perception experiments based on the contours documented in the Interactive Atlas of Spanish Intonation (Prieto and Roseano 2010). An utterance type selection task and a declarative to interrogative continuum judgment task were created from these utterances. Both tasks were presented through the Qualtrics platform to 57 Puerto Rican listeners and 35 Andalusian listeners. The findings indicated that both groups could identify declarative contours as declaratives. Both interrogative types of Puerto Rican contours were consistently identified as interrogatives by the Puerto Ricans listeners. Andalusian listeners were less certain recognizing broad focus interrogatives as a question. Counter-expectational contours were recognized as declaratives by Andalusian listeners. Results indicate that specific intonation patterns can be interpreted differently based on Spanish dialect and may result in the misinterpretation of the utterance.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">EJHR</abbr></div> <div id="arronizetpadilla2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Joke identification, comprehension and appreciation by Spanish intermediate ESL learners: an exploratory study</div> <div class="author"> Santiago Arróniz Parra, and <a href="https://www.us.es/trabaja-en-la-us/directorio/manuel-padilla-cruz" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Manuel Padilla Cruz</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The European Journal of Humour Research</em>, Apr 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.europeanjournalofhumour.org/ejhr/article/view/633" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/arronizpadilla2022_jokes.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper reports on an exploratory study examining joke identification, appreciation and comprehension by Spanish intermediate ESL learners. The study is based on a relevance-theoretic classification of jokes, which assumes that humorousness results from manipulation of three parametres: make-sense frames, cultural information and utterance interpretation. It firstly ascertains whether Spanish ESL learners recognise orally-delivered samples of seven types of purportedly jocular texts. Secondly, it examines whether these learners actually regard such texts as comical and why. Finally, it looks into the learners’ interpretative problems in order to single out which joke type(s) is/are more challenging. The study relies on quantitative and qualitative data elicited through an online questionnaire comprising four tasks. The results indicate no correlation between joke identification and appreciation, and independence of successful joke recognition from sophisticated interpretative skills. Jokes involving invalidation of an activated make-sense frame were most easily identified and found most funny, but jokes exploiting cancellation of an initial, seemingly plausible, interpretation posed more difficulties.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IULCWP</abbr></div> <div id="arroniz2021s" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Who’s motivated to trill?: A sociolinguistic study on the acquisition of Spanish trills in heterosyllabic sequences</div> <div class="author"> <em>Santiago Arróniz</em>, and <a href="https://spanport.indiana.edu/about/graduate-students/coulter-kern-mackenzie.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mackenzie Dawn Coulter-Kern</a> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IULC Working Papers</em>, Apr 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/iulcwp/article/view/32222" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/trills_iulcwp_2021.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This study aims to investigate the acquisition of trills in heterosyllabic sequences by speakers of Spanish as a second language (L2) and heritage speakers.

This paper aims to investigate whether intonation, as a prosodic component and, frequently, a distinctive feature of certain languages, can trigger different attitudes, depending on whether or not the identity of the speaker is disclosed. To this end, a group of ten speakers of peninsular Spanish participated in a perception study in which pitch modifications were used with a synthetic voice to reflect intonation contours specific to neutral polar questions and information-seeking wh-questions in two languages in contact: Spanish and Catalan. The participants heard two versions of each token, both of them in Spanish, but one with a Castilian-accented L+H* intonation, and the other with a Catalan-accented H+L* intonation. Subsequently, they heard the same audio recordings once again, but this time the place of origin of each manipulation was disclosed; that is, either from Madrid (Castilian) or Catalonia (Catalan). The results confirm not only that intonation is a linguistic trait that does trigger attitudes on its own, but also that there is a strong social dimension to how Spanish speakers perceive Catalan, beyond language.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Manuscript</abbr></div> <div id="arroniz2020c" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">High, or super-high, that is the question: Examining the role of pitch range in Peninsular Spanish</div> <div class="author"> <em>Santiago Arróniz</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Apr 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">M.A. Thesis</abbr></div> <div id="arroniz2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Joke Comprehesion by Spanish B2 level learners of English: A preliminary empirical study.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Santiago Arróniz</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Apr 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/11441/107564" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This work undertakes an empirical study of one of the least researched issues in interlanguage pragmatics so far: comprehension of jokes by Spanish learners of English as a second language (L2, henceforth). It seeks to examine whether these learners grasp the humor some joking texts are intended to produce, which types of jokes prove to be more difficult to understand and why. Adopting a relevance-theoretic perspective on comprehension, and, more precisely, the model of comprehension envisaged in the cognitive-pragmatic framework put forward by Sperber and Wilson (1986/1995), this work relies on the classification of jokes recently proposed by Yus (2016), where jokes are sorted out into seven different types depending on three parameters which are purportedly exploited by humorists in their creation and are, therefore, responsible for their triggering the expected effect. Consequently, this work presents the results obtained through an online questionnaire that was administered to students of English as an L2 with an upperintermediate, B2 level who were enrolled in one of the compulsory courses of the Degree in English Studies taught at the Universidad de Sevilla. Owing to its limitations, this work cannot but be considered an initial, exploratory study that aims to spark off further research contributing to a better and deeper understanding of the problems that L2 learners may face when processing humorous texts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Manuscript</abbr></div> <div id="arroniz2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The acquisition of intonation by L2 Spanish students (Proposal).</div> <div class="author"> <em>Santiago Arróniz</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Apr 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Manuscript</abbr></div> <div id="arroniz2018a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Intonational Patterns and Perception: A Contrastive Analysis between Peninsular and Puerto Rican Spanish.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Santiago Arróniz</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Apr 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Manuscript</abbr></div> <div id="arroniz2018b" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Inovação linguística na poesia de Mário de Sá-Carneiro.</div> <div class="author"> <em>Santiago Arróniz</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Apr 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>O objetivo do presente estudo é partir do poema “Como eu não possuo” para dar uma aproximação formal e linguística à poesia de Sá-Carneiro, e aprofundar na maneira em que o autor não só elege as palavras que melhor convêm-lhe, mas que também pode trocar estruturas morfológicas presumidamente estabelecidas na língua para dar um significado diferente.

For those purposes, we want to observe the number of impolite expressions that students at different levels of proficiency know, and if they can use them in context. We will use two different tasks in our study. The first one is a recognition task, based in Bardovi-Harlig and Bastos (2010). With this instrument, we aim to see if students can recognize impolite formulas. In the second task, a production task, we used an oral DCT with 12 different situations, and for each of them, we ask the students to provide an oral response. We will analyze the data obtained with these two instruments and categorize the productions according to Culpeper’s (2011, 2017) taxonomy of conventionalized impolite expressions. We propose that because students are not very familiar with this type of language, a pedagogical intervention could be proposed in a future study to include these expressions in the L2 Spanish classroom.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Manuscript</abbr></div> <div id="arronizcoulter2017a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A study of the production of trills after heterosyllabic consonants in non-native Spanish learners.</div> <div class="author"> S.

It has been proposed in previous studies (Schneider, 2005; Bieswanger, 2015) that in this particular speech act there can be a variety of strategies that monolingual speakers use to respond to thanks, but no focus has been put in an English-Spanish bilingual community. In this sense, the present research starts from those studies, and looks for the differences or similarities that may occur between bilingual and monolingual speakers. In order to do so, the first thing to consider is the norm in both languages, and then have a look at what really happens in a bilingual context. For this purpose, a DCT was spread among monolingual Spanish speakers to obtain their norm, and then, together with the norm in English obtained in previous research (Schneider, 2005; Bieswanger, 2015), compare both using natural data collected in a bilingual context. Overall, the results obtained from the data collected proved that there are some differences in fact in the way bilingual speakers behave when responding to thanks, showing an accommodation/assimilation to their L2, using strategies that were more common among the opposite community.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2024 Santiago Arróniz.
