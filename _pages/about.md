I'm an assistant professor of Hispanic linguistics at the University of Nevada, Reno. My research bridges phonetics, phonology, and computational linguistics, with a particular focus on gradient sound patterns in Spanish and their role in sound change. I combine experimental methods—such as acoustic analysis and perceptual studies—with computational approaches, including natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and the development of tools for analyzing speech and text.

My work examines phenomena such as consonant lenition, dialectal variation in Spanish, and the perceptual thresholds that shape category stability. Beyond phonology, I'm engaged in computational applications for Spanish linguistics, including NLP tools for analyzing learner writing and user-friendly interfaces for phonetic annotation and analysis workflows.
