**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  

This course is an introduction to basic concepts and methodology used in Spanish Linguistics. The main purpose of this course is to examine the linguistic structure of Spanish based on the principal fields of linguistic inquiry: word order (also known as syntax), word formation (morphology), the sound system (phonetics and phonology), history of the language and variation (sociolinguistics and  dialectology),  meaning  in  language  (semantics  and  pragmatics).  By  the  end  of  the  course students will have reviewed grammatical categories, diagramed sentences, analyzed words based on individual morphemes, learned the standard sounds of Spanish and how they vary from English, transcribed  phonetically  native  Spanish,  reviewed  the  historical  development  of  Spanish,  and produced an oral and written presentation on variation in Spanish, among others.
